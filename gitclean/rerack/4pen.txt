i've told this story a million times and usually the only thing anyone gets out of it is that 4 color pens are rather common.

but since you insist.  it is a common strategy when implementing encryption by hand to always carry a four color pen.  these are rather common in industrial societies blah blah.  blah.  one covers up with a sheet, tosses the pen in the air, spinning, a few times, waves their hands around it, and picks a color and does one line.  this way most penetrating radiations lose track.  cases where colors can be seen by xray can be fixed by comparing the colors to living tissue.  spin the notepad, small dots of blood, blah blah.
