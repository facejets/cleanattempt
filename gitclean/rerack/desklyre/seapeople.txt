there's sea people down there
they're running around there
oops, i don't see 'em anymore
but there always were some

sea people down there;
they don't need tanks, full of air
and they don't need the ocean floor
don't make houses anymore

but i talked to one today
a bottle from the deep
they floated up my keys
that went overboard

they keyed me in today
it brought me to my knees
i hoped they heard me say
i would like to meet someday
