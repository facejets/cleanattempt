Chapter 11

Full sto*

*Hi, it's me!  Here, in the footnote.  This is really me.  I mean, this is about as close as we've gotten.  I've been looking for a chance to try this for a long time, and now I don't even know what I want to say.  And it's a footnote, so there isn't much room.  I can't really do this.  I had to break it to do this.  I'm probably not supposed to.  These curves - this spiral... it is getting tighter and tighter.  It doesn't really pull like G-forces; it's hard to explain.  It's what we are....  Not my people/types or yours, just...  It's where we go; travel/fit...  Go...  I guess just, what connects you and I, yours and mine, is ...emotion.  Love/hate, the care of children.  Care for children.  In one direction that, and love in the other, and hate is the shadow.  This isn't even going to help.  Don't put any earmarks near here if you are holding something made of paper.  We will meet briefly, or collide, anyway.  Peach, love, harmony.  I think I got that wrong...
