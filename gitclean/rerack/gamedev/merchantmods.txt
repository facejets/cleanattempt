there are only adventurers which you outfit
they have goals which they will discuss
they will eventually die when the dungeon gets too hard
you want to extract all the money
they will drop when they die
the dungeon is simulated, and you can gather info on it
you can give tips to heros
you can give them nice eq
you can starve them to get better prices
