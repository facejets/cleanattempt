the witch that went to the city

a benevolent level creater god rips paper to save player from monster and tapes another sheet of paper on
the monsters are realistic but when damaged they turn to paper and can be removed
or everyone is paper and you banish the monsters

the monsters are 'only an idea' and are immortal, so you banish them by ripping paper so they fall inward/outward to the camera

switching to top down view is costly so you try to time it with clues of where it is instead
the clues are the platforms interaction with things

ripping off too much paper gives you nowhere to go as enemies approach from all sides
