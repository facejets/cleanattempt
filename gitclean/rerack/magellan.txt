magellan stood with a spyglass, scanning the horizon for some signal as the three men approached.  after a confrontation, we know the story intimately.

poofy clothes, etc. if magellan is not allowed to flash a signal mirror, all will die.  thus he buys time to tell more of his story.  he shows 2 ridiculously large rubies.  they wish to inspect them but he can't trust them.  he offers both.  he convinces them to handcuff eachother, each having a pair.  they form a triangle, and he shows them each the rubies up close.  (his feet shackled) if he kills one, the other two can unlock one.  this all so they can inspect.  they agree to let him signal.  he receives a signal back, after a pause.  #somehow the three choose who doesn't get a ruby (dice) and they are going to kill him.  magellan asks for the third as a servant, and gets.  magellan changes shape into a spaceship and asks the servant to enter, for all will die one the surface nearby when it launches.
