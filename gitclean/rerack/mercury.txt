Oh God - Mercury.  It was so beautiful.  And mankind too, these people who first yoked up a planet to plough the barren fields of a once Earth-like planet.

It was a beautiful time to see, and I wish I could have stayed to see the first results.  It was a beautiful time, but a terrifying one, too.  At first when I got here I didn't recognize this system.  I rarely check my radars.  But I think it was you I saw.  I hope it was you.  I need a boost.

And when I say they yoked a planet to plough another's fields, I mean it figuratively - they captured the beast and domesticated it, and used it for brute tasks.  You might think yoke is a term better saved for the relationships of the drive ensemble to the tiny ball you observe, orbiting Sol so closely.
