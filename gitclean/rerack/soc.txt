...The integers are a *cyclic* group... 
The integers are an example of an infinite cyclic group.  Now lets look at a finite cyclic group.

The classic example is the integers mod n under addition.
This is a finite group with n elements.
It is also generated by the number one, but something different happens here -

Look at all the positive and negative multiples of one.
Recall that n is congruent to zero mod n. n plus one is congruent to one mod n, and so on.
Negative one is congruent to n minus one, negative two is congruent to n minus two, and so on.
So the group generated by one repeats itself.
It cycles through the number zero through n minus one over and over.
This is why it is a cyclic group.
