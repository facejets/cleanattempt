I woke up in a study.  I could tell it was a study without anyone else's help, for it had a desk and some writing materials.  There was an open door so I peered around into the next room, and there was a woman there busy at something.  I cleared my throat and she asked me to enter, without looking.

I took a breath, but before I could speak, she spoke.

"Are you capable at math?" she said, entree to a negotiation that quickly resulted me in returning to the study to write down a symbol for a radical - the sort of 'checkmark with a long line sticking out from the top' that we write to say that we intend to take the square root of some element inside it.  I did so and took the paper back to her, but, still without looking, she told me that she didn't want the paper, and chastised me from not leaving it on the desk, mildly.  After putting it back I found that she wanted me to write a three inside it.  I thought it strange in an equal amount to the previous request, but upon making another, she added as an afterthought that the reason for it was that the square root of four was two.  This third request was that I draw parentheses

she doesn't have time to do the work
watch that mathologer to continue
