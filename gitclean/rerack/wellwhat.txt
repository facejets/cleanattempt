well what are you asking? i am becoming impatient; i do not like talking to merely one of you

i see the whole thing as a 'superposition of quantum states' - your words - what specific instance are you asking about?  your own?  which one of those? there are so many.  you want a particular one?  the one where the sword in your hand will defeat the enemy you meet on the battlefield tomorrow?  there are many of those, too.  there are many where the sword in your hand is not real; that you are hallucinating a sword; a battle; a battlefield.  you want only worlds where you exist; this is hard for me, but i will make do since we are talking.  there are worlds where you think you exist, but you really don't; not in that way.  you want worlds with wars.  these are many, but not all, worlds.

i can't separate it out; not for long.  there is no reason to.  the whole thing exists at once.
